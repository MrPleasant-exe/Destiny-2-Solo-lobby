# Destiny 2 matchmaking disable
A script that allows you to disable matchmaking in Destiny 2, all this script does is adds firewall rules when first ran and if rules are already in place (second run) it will disable them and re enable match making. 

## Why use this? 

So you can do bounties etc alone and not with pesky people :) 

## How do i use this?

Before trying to run the script you must allow Windows Powershell to run .ps1 files, this can be done by oppening Powershell as admin and typing the following. [Download](https://github.com/MrPleasant-exe/Destiny-2-Solo-lobby/releases).

> set-executionpolicy remotesigned

Once promoted type "a" and hit enter.

Once you have done that, right click the script > open with > windows powershell, don't worry if its blank, sometimes text wont load, if this is the case press any key. (if it closes this is also ok)
